- [FreeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/gargi_thakur)
- Referring [techinterviewhandbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=14&hours=14) to solve leetcode questions 

## Rules:
1. I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. I will tweet about my progress and encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day 
3. I will be tracking my progress in this repo
4. I will be working through- 
  - the FreeCodeCamp curriculum 
  - work on at least 1 Leetcode question 
  - I will also improve my portfolio website https://gargithakur.com and update my projects.
5. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses, and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

### Day 001: July 01, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: 
1. FreeCodeCamp- Completed Regular Expression section in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Curriculum
2. Leetcode ques.- [Valid parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/) learned to use stack data structure

**Thoughts:**
1. FreeCodeCamp- Learned a new concept in regex called Positive and Negative Lookahead (?= and ?!)which was confusing in the beginning but the examples in the exercises helped to understand that they can be quite useful to check patterns in a string.
2. Leetcode ques.
- Use hash table to store the pair brackets used to get constant time. 
- then use for loop to go through the string and push the bracket in stack array.
- if the s[i] is not an opening bracket then check if it's the closing bracket from the hash and check if the pair matches
- edge cases: if the given string is an empty string, return true. if the given string's length is <2, return false

### Day 002: July 02, 2022
**Today's Progress**: 
1. FreeCodeCamp- Completed Debugging section in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Curriculum
2. Leetcode ques.- [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

**Thoughts:**
1. FreeCodeCamp- I already knew all the concepts from debugging section but it was a good thing to revise the concepts.
2. Leetcode ques.- I learned about pointers
- Today I had fever, so was not able to give much time to coding. But I'm glad I was able to make some progress.
